## Programming Fundamentals  

What is **programming** and **coding**?

Computers follow step-by-step instructions to peform some action (program) from the user.  

People use programming languages to write instructions for computers.  

COMPUTER FETCH THESE INSTRUCTIONS, DECODE THEM, AND EXECUTE THEM.

This is what happens when you start your favorite and this is what happens from the moment you turn on your computer!

There are thousands of programming languages, in this camp we will focus on two popular languages, Java and Python.  

Minecraft is coded using the language Java.  

Some of us will be learning how to edit/write Minecraft mods using Python and some of us will be learning how to edit/write them using Java. We can even learn both!
